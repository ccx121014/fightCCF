fightCCF Prototype

This repository holds a full prototype skeleton for fightCCF. It includes:
- A minimal Express backend that serves chapter JSON and the public frontend
- A public frontend with HTML/CSS/JS stubs for UI, levels, animation, AI, auth, and sync
- Chapter data as JSON files for quick iteration

To run:
  cd server
  npm install
  npm run migrate
  npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

This commit adds the full prototype: frontend, backend, chapters, level runner, AI, animator, auth and sync.
