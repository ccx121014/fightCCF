Assets JS README

This folder contains multiple JavaScript modules that represent different subsystems of the prototype:
- secret, secret-crypto: hidden features and helpers
- ui: small UI utilities and toasts
- character-data: in-memory character persistence
- level & level-runner: basic level model and game loop
- animator, ai_boss: animation and AI stubs
- auth & sync-ui: authentication and synchronization stubs

These modules are intentionally minimal and serve as scaffolding for real implementations.
