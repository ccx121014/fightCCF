Deep README for the public prototype

This file should explain deep integration points, art/sound pipeline, and how to extend the prototype.

Key areas to expand:
- Asset pipeline (audio, sprite sheets)
- Level design format and runner contract
- Animator and animation states
- AI state machine for bosses
- Auth flow and synchronization strategy for multiplayer/progress sync

This repository includes placeholder implementations for many of these systems to make it easy to iterate on real implementations later.
